# README Generator-Node.js

## Description

This is a project where we were meant to create a project that generates a README by using Node.js and the Inquirer module. The project required the installation of Node.js, the Inquirer module, and the File System module. The project works by using Inquirer to prompt questions in the command line. After the user has answered all questions, the data is then used to write a file named README.md, that has a basic markdown outline. The data is placed in the appropriate places to fill out the readme for the specific project.

The generator includes questions about the title, description, usage, contributing, tests, contact, and also places a license badge and description based on which license was chosen in the prompted question.
